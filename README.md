# Spider's Web
Haven't you heard about Spider's web solo game? I doubt not. It's a silly game that was played by one person on a sheet of checkered paper. 
It was a fun during boring school lessons. You could play it alone. 
You start with a cross-like figure, drawn with dots and your aim is to build the biggest spider's web as possible.
You need to connect five dots in a row, a column or diagonally, but you can add only one new dot per move, then you can form a new line and score a point.
